    Available Tutorials:

    Generate a list of 3-4 tasks. Each task must be a JSON object with:
    - "id": A unique string ID for the task.
    - "title": A short, engaging title (e.g., "Boost Your Soil Knowledge").
    - "description": A 1-2 sentence explanation of why this task is helpful.
    - "action": One of the following action types: 'VIEW_TUTORIAL', 'CREATE_POST', 'EDIT_LISTING', 'INSPECT_CROP', 'LEARN_MORE'.
    - "targetId": (Optional) The ID of the tutorial or listing if relevant.
    - "xp": The experience points awarded for completing the task (between 10 and 50).

    Task Ideas:
    - Suggest a relevant tutorial from the list based on their crops.
    - Encourage them to share knowledge in the community.
    - Suggest improving an old marketplace listing.
    - Give a general farming tip as a 'LEARN_MORE' task.
